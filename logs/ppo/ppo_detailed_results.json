      "answer": "Science-based targets are greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals that are in line with the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to well below 2\u00b0C (3.6\u00b0F) and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F) above pre-industrial levels. These targets are based on the latest climate science and are considered 'science-based' because they are grounded in the most up-to-date research and data.\n\nScience-based targets are typically set using a methodology developed by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which is a partnership between CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project), the United Nations Global Compact, the World Resources Institute, and the World Wildlife Fund. The SBTi methodology uses a range of scenarios, including the 'low' (1.5\u00b0C) and 'high' (2.5\u00b0C or higher) global warming scenarios, to determine the level of emissions reductions required to meet the Paris Agreement goals.\n\nScience-based targets are considered a key component of a company's climate strategy and are often used as a benchmark for assessing the effectiveness of climate-related disclosures and reporting. They are also seen as a way for companies to demonstrate their commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to the global effort to mitigate climate change.",

      "answer": "Carbon accounting is the process of measuring, recording, and reporting the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or carbon sequestration associated with an organization's activities, products, or services. It involves tracking the sources and sinks of GHG emissions, as well as the removal or enhancement of carbon stocks through activities such as reforestation or afforestation.\n\nCarbon accounting can be used for various purposes, including:\n\n1. Corporate inventory accounting: to measure and report an organization's GHG emissions and removals.\n2. Project-based accounting: to measure and report the GHG emissions and removals associated with specific projects, such as carbon sequestration projects.\n3. Voluntary carbon markets: to quantify and sell carbon credits generated through activities such as reforestation or renewable energy projects.\n\nCarbon accounting involves several steps, including:\n\n1. Identifying the scope of the accounting: determining which activities, products, or services are included in the accounting.\n2. Measuring GHG emissions or removals: using methods such as life cycle assessment (LCA) or direct measurement to quantify GHG emissions or removals.\n3. Reporting GHG emissions or removals: presenting the results of the measurement in a clear and transparent manner.\n4. Using internal carbon prices: applying a carbon price to inform investment decisions, valuation of potential liabilities, or as an input to financial estimates and scenarios.\n\nCarbon accounting is an important tool for organizations to understand their GHG emissions and removals, and to make informed decisions about reducing their carbon footprint and contributing to climate change mitigation efforts.",

Note that if the fraction of carbon in the feedstock (CF) includes carbon accounted for \nthrough o ther end uses (e.g., combustion of PSA purge gas), these emissions will be double \ncounted. To avoid double counting, the quantity of carbon accounted for elsewhere should be \nsubtracted from the feedstock rate.

An example calculation for a fluid coker is shown in Exhibit 6.11 -4. \n\uf0b7 Flexi-cokers produce a low -Btu gas that is combusted through a fuel gas system or a \nflare,",
      "answer": "Carbon offsets are a mechanism used to compensate for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that cannot be reduced or eliminated. They work by investing in projects or activities that reduce GHG emissions elsewhere, thereby offsetting the emissions from a specific source.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how carbon offsets work:\n\n1. **Emissions are generated**: A company, individual, or activity produces GHG emissions, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), or other greenhouse gases.\n2. **Emissions are quantified**: The amount of GHG emissions is calculated using emission factors or other methods.\n3. **Carbon offset is purchased**: The entity responsible for the emissions purchases carbon offsets from a certified project or program.\n4. **Offset project is verified**: The carbon offset project is verified by a third-party auditor to ensure that it meets certain standards and criteria, such as reducing emissions by a specific amount.\n5. **Emissions are reduced**: The carbon offset project reduces GHG emissions, such as by:\n\t* Capturing and storing CO2 from a power plant or industrial process.\n\t* Promoting reforestation or afforestation.\n\t* Implementing energy-efficient technologies.\n\t* Reducing waste or methane emissions.\n6. **Carbon credits are issued**: The project generates carbon credits, which represent the reduced GHG emissions.\n7. **Carbon credits are retired**: The entity that purchased the carbon offset retires the corresponding number of carbon credits, which ensures that the emissions are not double-counted.\n\nCarbon offsets can be used in various sectors, including:\n\n* **Voluntary carbon markets**: Companies or individuals can purchase carbon offsets to compensate for their emissions.\n* **Compliance markets**: Governments or regulatory bodies may require companies to purchase carbon offsets to meet emissions reduction targets.\n* **Sustainable development projects**: Carbon offsets can be used to fund projects that promote sustainable development, such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, or reforestation.\n\nIt's essential to note that not all carbon offsets are created equal. To ensure that carbon offsets are effective, look for projects that are:\n\n* **Verified**: Third-party audited and verified to ensure that emissions are reduced.\n* **Certified**: Meet recognized standards, such as the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) or the Gold Standard.\n* **Transparent**: Provide clear information about the project's emissions reduction, costs, and benefits.\n\nBy investing in high-quality carbon offsets, individuals and organizations can help reduce their GHG emissions and contribute to a more sustainable future.",
