Identify the activities, processes, and sources that contribute to GHG emissions within these boundaries.\n\n2. **Gather data and information**: Collect relevant data and information from various sources, including:\n\t* Energy consumption records (electricity, heat, fuel)\n\t* Fuel consumption records (gasoline, diesel, natural gas)\n\t* Emissions from industrial processes (cement, steel, pulp and paper)\n\t* Emissions from waste disposal (landfills, incinerators)\n\t* Emissions from transportation (fleet data, air travel)\n\t* Emissions from agricultural activities (fertilizer use, manure management)\n\t* Emissions from land use changes (deforestation, land degradation)\n\n3.",
